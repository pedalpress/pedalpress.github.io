# Welcome to PedalPress!

![](static/img/pedalpress.png)

## This site is currently under construction but will soon house all sorts of bicycley goodness.

## What is PedalPress?

PedalPress is a collective of technology loving bicycle riders.  We want to make the process of designing, buying, and building (or upgrading) your bike much easier than it currently is.


## When will the site be up and running?

We hope to take a beta online by July 2017!  Feel free to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pedal_press) to keep up with any news.
