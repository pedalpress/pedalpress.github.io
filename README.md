## What is Pedal Press?

Pedal Press is a collective of technology-loving bicycle riders.  We want to make the process of designing, building, and buying (or upgrading) your bike much easier than it currently is by cataloguing and indexing all sorts of useful data, and displaying it in helpful ways.

## When will the site be up and running?

The beta ride is planned for July 2017!  Feel free to [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pedal_press) to keep up with any news.

### Thanks for checking us out!
